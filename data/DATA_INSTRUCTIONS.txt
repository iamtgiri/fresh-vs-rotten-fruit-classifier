INSTRUCTIONS: Dataset Preparation

1. Visit the Kaggle dataset page:
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swoyam2609/fresh-and-stale-classification/data

2. Download the dataset manually. You may need to log in and accept the terms if prompted.

3. Extract the contents into the following folder relative to this project directory:
   fresh-vs-rotten-fruit-classifier/data/dataset/

   Your directory structure should look like this after extraction:

   data/
   └── dataset/
       └── Train/
           ├── freshapples/
           ├── rottenapples/
           ├── ...
       └── Test/
           ├── freshapples/
           ├── rottenapples/
           ├── ...

4. Once extracted, run the data splitting script:
   `python scripts/split_data.py`

This will create the split dataset in:
   `data/split_dataset/`
